				cash back rates and hunting for coupons?  Well, never again!

				<div class="returnToTop"><a href="#top">Return to Top</a></div>
					
				<a name="1-2"></a>
				<h3>What is Cash Back?</h3>
				<p class="a">When you shop through Extrabux at one of our trusted 
stores, we earn a sales commission on virtually anything you purchase 
from that store. We pass the majority of this commission back to you as 
"cash back".</p>

				<div class="returnToTop"><a href="#top">Return to Top</a></div>

				<a name="1-3"></a>
				<h3>Where do I begin?</h3>
				<p class="a">First, <a href="http://www.extrabux.com/users/register">Sign Up</a>

that sell that product as well as the list price, sales tax, shipping 
cost, cash back discount, and coupon savings at each store. Coupon 
savings will be applied to the price during the store's checkout 
process. After making your purchase, that store will notify us of the 
purchase and your cash back will be posted to your Extrabux account 
within 1-4 days of the item shipping from the store. <a href="http://www.extrabux.com/users/register">Sign Up Now</a> to start saving money.</p>

only need to provide us with an email address and password to get 
started. If you are not an Extrabux member, you can still use Extrabux 
to compare prices, find coupons, and browse products, but you will not 
earn cash back.</p>

				<h3>Am I buying directly from Extrabux?</h3>
				<p class="a">No. Extrabux is not a store and does not sell any 
products. Extrabux is a shopping portal that helps you compare prices 
and save money when you shop online. If you have any questions about the
 product(s) you ordered, please contact the store from which you bought 
that product.</p>

				<h3>I'm having trouble finding a product. What should I do?</h3>
				<p class="a">Try again. Extrabux's search engine covers millions of 
different products, so here are some tips to help you find what you're 
looking for:</p>
				<ul class="faq-list">

					<li>Mouse traps, a computer mouse, or the latest Modest Mouse CD? 
Words often have multiple meanings and implications, so be sure your 
search phrase clearly specifies the type of product you're looking for.</li>
					<li>Be specific. If you're looking for a particular product, try typing that product's model number into the Extrabux search bar.</li>
		    	    <li>Refine Search. Be sure to use the filters on the left side of the search results to help narrow and improve the results.</li>
				</ul>

				<a name="2-5"></a>

				<h3>How does Extrabux choose which stores to list on its site?</h3>
				<p class="a">The majority of Extrabux stores (about 1500) are within
 the top 2,000 online retailers.  We know that in addition to price you 
want a safe and secure shopping experience matched with reliability and 
honesty from the store.  For this reason we take great care in choosing 
our stores and personally reviewing each store listed on Extrabux to 
ensure that you have a pleasant shopping experience. If you ever have an
 issue with an Extrabux store, please let us know.</p>
				<div class="returnToTop"><a href="#top">Return to Top</a></div>

				<a name="2-6"></a>
				<h3>Does Extrabux search stores that are close to my house?</h3>
				<p class="a">At this time, Extrabux only searches online stores.</p>

				<div class="returnToTop"><a href="#top">Return to Top</a></div>

				<a name="2-7"></a>
				<h3>What does "Extrabux Price" include?</h3>
				<p class="a">To make sure you find the lowest price and save the 
most money, Extrabux makes shopping online as transparent as possible. 
The Extrabux Price listed on the Compare Prices page includes the list 
price, sales tax, shipping cost, cash back discount, and coupon savings.
 Because we include cash back and coupon savings, the Extrabux Price 
will almost always be lower than prices on other comparison shopping 
websites.</p>
				<div class="returnToTop"><a href="#top">Return to Top</a></div>

				<a name="2-8"></a>

				<h3>Why do store prices sometimes differ from the list price I saw on Extrabux?</h3>
				<p class="a">Extrabux does its best to show accurate list prices, 
but sometimes a store will change its price before we've had a chance to
 update our database.</p>
				<div class="returnToTop"><a href="#top">Return to Top</a></div>

				<a name="2-9"></a>
				<h3>Why do tax and shipping costs sometimes differ from what I saw on Extrabux?</h3>
				<p class="a">Extrabux does its best to show accurate tax and 
shipping costs, but please keep in mind that for some stores, the tax 
and shipping costs shown are only estimates. Sales tax estimates are 
based on your zip code and the sales tax policies of the merchant. 
Shipping cost estimates are based on the product weight, shipping 
destination, distribution center location, and carrier used (UPS, USPS, 
FedEx, etc.). In some cases, however, Extrabux is not provided with all 
information necessary to estimate the exact tax and shipping costs.</p>

				<div class="returnToTop"><a href="#top">Return to Top</a></div>
				
				<a name="2-10"></a>
				<h3>How does Extrabux and the store track my order so I get cash back?</h3>
				<p class="a">Anytime you click to a store site from Extrabux, we 
keep a record of what retailer you clicked to.  We DON'T know what you 
browse for at the merchant site.  Our tracking stops with the click to 
the merchant site. The store tracks when you enter their site and where 
you entered from (Extrabux). They may track the items you browse and the
 items you place in your cart and what you order.  Within a few days of 
completing the order (after your order is shipped), the store should 
report the order back to Extrabux and we post the cash back to your 
account!</p>
				<p>There are a few things that can mess up the tracking and cancel the cash back:</p>
				<ul class="faq-list">
					<li>Only go to the store website from Extrabux. Going from ANYwhere
 else can mess up the tracking and Extrabux won't get credit for your 
order. Only use coupon codes that are posted on Extrabux. Most stores 
track the source of the coupon codes and if it didn't come from Extrabux
 then we won't get credit for your order.</li>

					<li>Only place items in your cart AFTER you click through from 
Extrabux. If you visit the store website and put items in your cart 
before you click through from Extrabux the store will not give Extrabux 
credit for referring your order.</li>
					<li>Don't wait too long before completing your order.  The idea is 
to be relatively quick and efficient so the tracking is clear and tracks
 back to Extrabux. If you get distracted (by work, kids, life, etc.) 
it's best to remove items from your cart, then go back to Extrabux and 
click through to the store website again to start a new tracking 
session.</li>
					<li>The tracking ends when you complete an order.  If you want to 
place another order, even for the same item, make sure you exit the 
store and click back through from Extrabux to start a new tracking 
session.  This way when you checkout again we can give you cash back on 
both orders.</li>

				<div class="returnToTop"><a href="#top">Return to Top</a></div>

				<a name="2-11"></a>
				<h3>I want to place multiple orders at the same store. Do I have to sign out and sign back in?</h3>
				<p class="a">Yes and no. Each time you click through to a store from
 Extrabux you start a tracking code. That tracking code is ended when 
you place an order, exit the store without ordering (including closing 
your browser), or time just runs out on the tracking. If you checkout 
once but want to keep shopping, even for the same item right after the 
first order, the store doesn't have a unique tracking code to assign to 
it because the tracking closed after the first checkout.</p>
				<p>If you want to place multiple orders (checking-out more than 
once), after you checkout the first time you need to go back to Extrabux
 and click back to the store website again through a link on Extrabux. 
That will start a new tracking code so you can get cash back the next 
time you checkout. The store may have saved items in your cart for you. 
You need to make sure your cart is empty each time you click over from 
Extrabux to make sure you get cash back. Then put the items back in your
 cart and checkout again for the next order.</p>

				<h3>I am having difficulty using some features on Extrabux.  Do I need javascript enabled?</h3>
				<p class="a">Yes, it is recommended you enable javascript.  Without 
javascript you may have difficulty using some of Extrabux's features, 
including: Shop by Category, Payment Requests, "Click to Copy Code" on 
coupons, auto-complete on searches, and aspects of the Refer-a-Friend 
program.  To enable javascript please <a href="http://www.enable-javascript.com/">click here</a> and follow the instructions for your browser.</p>

			<h2>3. Using Extrabux Coupons</h2>		
			
				<a name="3-1"></a>

				<h3>How do I use coupons on Extrabux?</h3>
				<p class="a"></p>
				<ul class="faq-list">
					<li>If no coupon code is required, simply click the coupon link and
 the coupon discount will automatically be applied to your order during 
the store's checkout process.</li>
					<li>If a coupon code is required, simply click our coupon link and 
we will automatically copy the coupon code for you while redirecting you
 to the store site. Then go shopping!  During your checkout process look
 for the "Promotion Code" or "Coupon Code" field.  Once you find it, 
right-click inside of this field and select "Paste" and then click the 
"Update Price" button if there is one.</li>
					<li>Note that using a coupon or promotion code not found on 
Extrabux may cancel the cash back you receive from Extrabux.  Stores 
track the codes they issue and may give credit for the order to the 
source of the coupon instead of to Extrabux, therefore preventing us 
from paying you cash back.</li>
				</ul>

				<div class="returnToTop"><a href="#top">Return to Top</a></div>

				<a name="3-2"></a>
				<h3>When do I receive discounts from coupons?</h3>
				<p class="a">Discounts from coupons are applied during the store's 
checkout process. Discounts from cash back, however, are posted to your 
Extrabux account 1-4 days after your order ships from the store.</p>
				<div class="returnToTop"><a href="#top">Return to Top</a></div>

				<a name="3-3"></a>

				<h3>Can I use coupons not provided by Extrabux and still earn cash back?</h3>
				<p class="a">Not usually. If you use a coupon not provided by 
Extrabux, you may not be eligible to earn cash back on the purchase. 
Even coupon codes you receive in an email or regular mail directly from 
the store can invalidate your cash back.  The stores oftentimes use 
coupon codes to determine the source of the order. So even if you click 
through Extrabux, but use a coupon code not found on Extrabux, the store
 will credit the order to the source of the coupon code and not 
Extrabux.  If we don't receive a commission on the order then we have no
 cash back to pay you.  It's best to check the Extrabux store page to 
see if there is a similar code available that you can use and still get 
cash back. If not, we always suggest you find the best deal for you.</p>
				<ul class="faq-list">
					<li><strong>Remember, if the store doesn't pay us the commission, we can't pay you the cash back.</strong></li>
				</ul>
				<div class="returnToTop"><a href="#top">Return to Top</a></div>
				
				<a name="3-4"></a>

				<h3>I received a coupon code in an email from my favorite store for a
 discount on my order. Can I use that coupon code and still get cash 
back?</h3>
				<p class="a">Unfortunately, probably not. You can only use coupon 
codes that are posted on Extrabux and still get cash back for your 
order. Check the Extrabux page for that store to see what coupons we 
have available. We may have the same offer or different coupon offers. 
If we have the same offer (for example, 10% off your order) but a 
different code, make sure you use the code from Extrabux so you can 
still get cash back.</p>
				<p>Make sure you only use coupon and promotion codes that are posted
 on Extrabux if you want cash back for your order. If you use a 
different code the store won't send us a commission for your order and 
we won't be able to share it with you as cash back.</p>

				<h3>I saw a coupon code for a discount at a store but the code is 
not on Extrabux. What can I do? Should I place the order and use that 
code anyway?</h3>

				<p class="a">Unfortunately, you can't use a code you found somewhere
 else and still get cash back from Extrabux. But check Extrabux and you 
might find a similar deal.  If you want to, send us an email and we'll 
try to post that same offer, or maybe even a better one on Extrabux!  In
 the end, we always recommend that you do what's best for you.</p>

				<h3>Why doesn't Extrabux offer coupons at certain stores?</h3>
				<p class="a">Unfortunately, some stores do not provide us with 
coupons. Extrabux works as hard as possible to provide you with the 
largest selection of quality working coupons.  If you know about a 
coupon that's available at a store you can email us about it. We'll try 
as hard as we can to get the same coupon on Extrabux. But remember, if 
we can't get the coupon posted on Extrabux and you use it for your 
order, the store may not pay us a commission and you won't get cash 
back.</p>

			<h2>4. Extrabux Cash Back</h2>		
			
				<a name="4-1"></a>
				<h3>What is Cash Back?</h3>
				<p class="a">When you shop through Extrabux at one of our trusted 
stores, we earn a sales commission on virtually anything you purchase 
from that store. We pass the majority of this commission back to you as 
"cash back".</p>
				<div class="returnToTop"><a href="#top">Return to Top</a></div>

				<a name="4-2"></a>

				<h3>Can I make purchases directly from the merchant and still receive cash back?</h3>
				<p class="a">No. In order to receive cash back from Extrabux on your
 purchase, you must first Log in to Extrabux and click on the Extrabux 
link to the store's website. The stores track the source of visit 
(Extrabux) and what you buy and pay Extrabux a commission on those 
items.  We then deposit a majority of this commission into your Extrabux
 account in the form of cash back.</p>
				<div class="returnToTop"><a href="#top">Return to Top</a></div>

				<a name="4-3"></a>
				<h3>Do I get my cash back from Extrabux or the merchant?</h3>
				<p class="a">You will receive your cash back payments from Extrabux 
via check or PayPal. If you opt to receive payments through the mail, 
your check will be sent through Bank of America and will arrive in a 
Bank of America envelope; enclosed will be a check to you from Extrabux,
 Inc. If you are located outside of the United States, you are not 
eligible to receive paper checks, but you are still eligible to receive 
cash back through PayPal.</p>

				<div class="returnToTop"><a href="#top">Return to Top</a></div>

				<a name="4-4"></a>
				<h3>Do I have to be an Extrabux member to get cash back?</h3>
				<p class="a">In order to receive cash back you must first <a href="http://www.extrabux.com/users/register">Sign Up</a>
 for an Extrabux account. It is a very quick and simple process and you 
only need to provide us with an email address and password to get 
started. If you are not an Extrabux member, you can still use Extrabux 
to compare prices, find coupons, and browse products, but you will not 
earn cash back.</p>
				<div class="returnToTop"><a href="#top">Return to Top</a></div>

				<a name="4-5"></a>
				<h3>Do I have to sign in every time before I shop to earn cash back?</h3>
				<p class="a">Yes. In order for us to track your purchase and give 
you cash back in your account, you must Sign In to your Extrabux account
 before you go shopping. If you've signed in before from that computer, 
you'll notice that you remain logged in and can begin shopping 
immediately.  If you are ever not sure if you are logged in or not, it 
is always best to log in once again. And if anyone else uses the same 
computer and has their own Extrabux account, you'll want to make sure 
that you are logged into YOUR account before you click on an Extrabux 
store link.</p>
				<div class="returnToTop"><a href="#top">Return to Top</a></div>

				<a name="4-6"></a>
				<h3>Do I earn cash back on everything I buy at a store, or only for the product I found at Extrabux?</h3>

				<p class="a">As long as you click on a product, store, or coupon 
link from Extrabux, you will earn cash back on all eligible purchases 
you make during your store visit. A store visit means the same web 
browsing session (not to exceed 24 hours, although it's best to complete
 your purchase more quickly) in which you click on an Extrabux product 
or store link. Note: On rare occasions a store may exclude a particular 
item from cash back. When the store lets us know in advance we will post
 that item on the Extrabux store page to let you know.</p>
				<div class="returnToTop"><a href="#top">Return to Top</a></div>
				
				<a name="4-7"></a>
				<h3>How does Extrabux and the store track my order so I get cash back?</h3>
				<p class="a">Anytime you click to a store site from Extrabux, we 
keep a record of what retailer you clicked to.  We DON'T know what you 
browse for at the merchant site.  Our tracking stops with the click to 
the merchant site. The store tracks when you enter their site and where 
you entered from (Extrabux). They may track the items you browse and the
 items you place in your cart and what you order.  Within a few days of 
completing the order (after your order is shipped), the store should 
report the order back to Extrabux and we post the cash back to your 
account!</p>
				<p>There are a few things that can mess up the tracking and cancel the cash back:</p>

				<ul class="faq-list">
					<li>Only go to the store website from Extrabux. Going from ANYwhere
 else can mess up the tracking and Extrabux won't get credit for your 
order. Only use coupon codes that are posted on Extrabux. Most stores 
track the source of the coupon codes and if it didn't come from Extrabux
 then we won't get credit for your order.</li>
					<li>Only place items in your cart AFTER you click through from 
Extrabux. If you visit the store website and put items in your cart 
before you click through from Extrabux the store will not give Extrabux 
credit for referring your order.</li>
					<li>Don't wait too long before completing your order.  The idea is 
to be relatively quick and efficient so the tracking is clear and tracks
 back to Extrabux. If you get distracted (by work, kids, life, etc.) 
it's best to remove items from your cart, then go back to Extrabux and 
click through to the store website again to start a new tracking 
session.</li>
					<li>The tracking ends when you complete an order.  If you want to 
place another order, even for the same item, make sure you exit the 
store and click back through from Extrabux to start a new tracking 
session.  This way when you checkout again we can give you cash back on 
both orders.</li>

				<div class="returnToTop"><a href="#top">Return to Top</a></div>

				<a name="4-8"></a>
				<h3>I want to place multiple orders at the same store. Do I have to sign out and sign back in?</h3>
				<p class="a">Yes and no. Each time you click through to a store from
 Extrabux you start a tracking code. That tracking code is ended when 
you place an order, exit the store without ordering (including closing 
your browser), or time just runs out on the tracking. If you checkout 
once but want to keep shopping, even for the same item right after the 
first order, the store doesn't have a unique tracking code to assign to 
it because the tracking closed after the first checkout.</p>
				<p>If you want to place multiple orders (checking-out more than 
once), after you checkout the first time you need to go back to Extrabux
 and click back to the store website again through a link on Extrabux. 
That will start a new tracking code so you can get cash back the next 
time you checkout. The store may have saved items in your cart for you. 
You need to make sure your cart is empty each time you click over from 
Extrabux to make sure you get cash back. Then put the items back in your
 cart and checkout again for the next order.</p>
				<div class="returnToTop"><a href="#top">Return to Top</a></div>

				<a name="4-9"></a>
				<h3>What if I accidentally close my web browser window while 
shopping at one of the merchant sites? Do I need to go back to the site 
through Extrabux?</h3>
				<p class="a">To make sure you earn your cash back, please return to 
the store site by clicking through the Extrabux product, store, or 
coupon link if you accidentally close your web browser window while 
shopping. To ensure you receive cash back on all your items it is always
 best to empty your shopping cart before you begin shopping again. Then 
just re-add those items after clicking through from Extrabux to the 
store site.  Stores track when you put items in your cart, and it's best
 for all items to be added to your cart during the same browser session 
(that originated in a transfer from Extrabux) on the same day. Also, if 
you went to the store site directly without clicking through from 
Extrabux first, be sure to remove all items from your cart and re-add 
them after clicking through from ExtrabuxÂ—then checkout.  This way all 
items will be properly commissioned to Extrabux and we can pay you cash 
back! </p>
				<ul class="faq-list">
					<li><strong>Remember, if the store doesn't pay us a commission, then we can't share it with you as cash back.</strong></li>
				</ul>
				<div class="returnToTop"><a href="#top">Return to Top</a></div>

				<a name="4-10"></a>
				<h3>What if the Extrabux screen closes while I'm shopping?</h3>
				<p class="a">If you've already clicked the product or store link 
from Extrabux, don't worry if the Extrabux screen closes while you're 
shopping, you will still earn cash back! But if you want to place 
another order at the same or a different store, you need to open up a 
new Extrabux screen and click through to the store again for your next 
order and the next time you checkout.  After checking out always do a 
fresh click to a store website if you want to keep shopping and get cash
 back.</p>
				<div class="returnToTop"><a href="#top">Return to Top</a></div>

				<a name="4-11"></a>
				<h3>Can I use coupons not provided by Extrabux and still earn cash back?</h3>

				<p class="a">Not usually. If you use a coupon not provided by 
Extrabux, you may not be eligible to earn cash back on the purchase. 
Even coupon codes you receive in an email or regular mail directly from 
the store can invalidate your cash back.  The stores oftentimes use 
coupon codes to determine the source of the order. So even if you click 
through Extrabux, but use a coupon code not found on Extrabux, the store
 will credit the order to the source of the coupon code and not 
Extrabux.  If we don't receive a commission on the order then we have no
 cash back to pay you.  It's best to check the Extrabux store page to 
see if there is a similar code available that you can use and still get 
cash back. If not, we always suggest you find the best deal for you.</p>
				<ul class="faq-list">
					<li><strong>Remember, if the store doesn't pay us the commission, we can't pay you the cash back.</strong></li>

				<h3>Why doesn't Extrabux offer cash back at certain stores?</h3>

				<p class="a">Unfortunately, some stores do not participate in all or
 any incentive programs. Others do not allow Extrabux to track your 
purchase. Without tracking your purchase, Extrabux is unable to provide 
cash back. We are always looking for new stores to add to Extrabux.  If 
you have a favorite store and want to earn cash back, let us know and 
we'll see if we can add them to Extrabux!</p>

				<a name="4-13"></a>
				<h3>The Holidays are coming and I want to order gifts through Extrabux. Can I order gifts and still get cash back?</h3>
				<p class="a">Yes! You can do all of your online gift orders through 
Extrabux in the comfort of your own home. Just make sure you start a new
 tracking session after each checkout by clicking through from Extrabux 
to the store for each gift recipient. Even if you want to order the same
 thing at the same store, each time you checkout the tracking ends. You 
need to click back through from Extrabux to the store to start a new 
tracking session so you can get cash back for the next order. Your 
friends and family get the gifts and you get the cash back!
				(Note, that you don't have to do this if the store you are ordering 
from allows you to place one order and send it to multiple shipping 
addresses (gift recipients) with just one checkout from the store.)</p>
				<ul class="faq-list">
					<li><strong>Just remember to click back through from Extrabux after
 each checkout. Remember, if the store won't pay us the commission for 
your order, then we can't pay you the cash back.</strong></li>

				</ul>
				<div class="returnToTop"><a href="#top">Return to Top</a></div>

				<a name="4-14"></a>
				<h3>Can I use or buy a gift certificate or gift card and still get cash back?</h3>
				<p class="a">Sometimes. For many stores, we cannot provide cash back
 on purchases made with gift cards (however, Extrabux Refer-a-Friend 
gift card bonuses DO qualify for cash back when used through Extrabux). 
We are also unable to provide cash back on most gift card purchases, 
except for stores in our Gift Cards category.</p>
				<div class="returnToTop"><a href="#top">Return to Top</a></div>

				<a name="4-15"></a>
				<h3>Do I have to do anything at checkout to make sure I earn my Extrabux cash back?</h3>
				<p class="a">Nope. As long as you used an Extrabux link to get to 
the retail site where you are making your purchase, and followed the 
correct procedures for your purchase (such as only clicking through from
 Extrabux, only using coupons from Extrabux, and making sure your cart 
was empty when you started shopping at that store), you will receive 
your cash back in your Extrabux account. But your cash back will not 
show up immediately after you purchase the item; it usually takes 1-4 
days after shipping (in rare cases, it can take up to 20 days) for the 
purchase to post to your account.</p>
				<div class="returnToTop"><a href="#top">Return to Top</a></div>

				<a name="4-16"></a>
				<h3>Why doesn't my cash back show up when I check out?</h3>

				<p class="a">Even though your cash back doesn't show up at checkout,
 don't worry, you are still earning cash back. Usually within 1-4 days 
after the item ships you will be able to view your earnings by clicking 
on the My Account link at Extrabux. Some sites, however, can take as 
long as 20 days (after the shipping date) to notify us of your purchase.
 Once the store notifies us of your purchase, Extrabux will email you to
 let you know that you have earned cash back in your account.</p>
				<div class="returnToTop"><a href="#top">Return to Top</a></div>

				<a name="4-17"></a>
				<h3>It has been longer than 4 days and a purchase isn't showing up in my account. What should I do?</h3>
				<p class="a">Purchases typically take 1-4 days after your order ships to post to your account. If it has been longer than 4 days, please <a href="http://www.extrabux.com/help/contact">Contact Us</a>
 and choose "Where's My Cash Back?" as the Subject. Please make sure 
that you have received the order and shipping confirmation from the 
store before filing a Missing Purchase Report. It is also possible that 
your cash back has not posted to your account for other reasons:</p>

				<ul class="faq-list">
					<li>You used a coupon or promotion code not provided by Extrabux</li>
				    <li>You added items to your shopping cart before clicking through from Extrabux</li>
				    <li>You have cookies disabled</li>
				    <li>You closed your web browser window before completing your purchase</li>
					<li>You waited too long to complete your purchase and the tracking cookie expired(more than 24 hours)</li>

				    <li>You checked out from the store multiple times, but only clicked through from Extrabux once (the first time)</li>
					<li>An unknown error on the merchant's side</li>
				</ul>
				<p>NOTE that Missing Purchase Reports must be submitted to Extrabux 
within 90 days of the purchase date. We will do everything we can to 
work with the store to get your cash back, but if they refuse to pay us 
the commission, then we will not be able to share it with you as cash 
back. When filing a Missing Purchase Report, please be sure to give us 
as much information as possible on the order, so we can make the best 
case to the store.  Also, think through anything you may have done that 
could have invalidated the cash back, as this information is also 
helpful, as we work through possible scenarios with the store.</p>
				<div class="returnToTop"><a href="#top">Return to Top</a></div>

				<a name="4-18"></a>

				<h3>What is the difference between Pending, Available, and Processing cash back, as shown in my account?</h3>
				<p class="a">Pending cash back is the amount that you have earned 
but that cannot yet be withdrawn because the return time (90 days) on 
those purchases have not yet passed. Once the 90 day return time passes,
 the cash back for that purchase will become "Available," and cash back 
can be withdrawn, ($10 minimum). After you request Available cash back 
it becomes Processing until the cash back is sent out (usually within 5 
business days).</p>
				<div class="returnToTop"><a href="#top">Return to Top</a></div>

				<a name="4-19"></a>
				<h3>How long will I have to wait for my cash back to become Available?</h3>
				<p class="a">Your purchase will be posted to your account within 1-4
 days, but your earnings on a specific purchase will become Available 
for payment once the return time on that purchase has passed. Return 
times vary depending on the store but are generally between 15-75 days. 
Once the return time has passed, your cash back earnings will become 
available for withdrawal.</p>

				<div class="returnToTop"><a href="#top">Return to Top</a></div>
				
				<a name="4-20"></a>
				<h3>Cash back in My Account is listed as Unavailable.  What does that mean?</h3>
				<p class="a">Cash back becomes "Unavailable" when the merchant 
notifies Extrabux that the purchase may be fraudulent. In rare cases, 
your purchase may incorrectly be marked as fraudulent. If this is the 
case, please let us know and we will review the purchase with the 
merchant, and change the cash back to Available if appropriate.  Until 
we hear from you we will need to withhold payment of this cash back, so 
please <a href="http://www.extrabux.com/help/contact">Contact Us</a>.</p>

				<h3>Can I use any payment method at a store's checkout and still earn cash back?</h3>
				<p class="a">You can use your credit card, debit card, or PayPal 
account at checkout and still earn cash back. For other payment methods 
(Google Checkout, Bill Me Later, etc.), we can't guarantee that your 
purchase will be reported to Extrabux correctly, but we are working hard
 to improve our service and support all payment methods in the future.</p>

				<div class="returnToTop"><a href="#top">Return to Top</a></div>

				<h3>How do I return a product I bought from an Extrabux store?</h3>

				<p class="a">Please check with the store from which you bought the 
product in order to determine their return policy. Send your returns 
directly to that store and not to Extrabux, as the product was not 
purchased from Extrabux. If you return, cancel, or exchange part or all 
of a purchase, please keep in mind that your cash back will be reversed 
for the item(s) returned.  Also note that if you have a problem with 
your order and you end up dealing with the store's customer service, 
they may change the order type from an online order to a phone or other 
type of order, which may cancel the commission paid to Extrabux since 
Extrabux can only get commissions from online orders.  Whenever 
possible, be sure to request they make no changes to the referrer of the
 order (Extrabux), so we get commissioned and can pay you cash back. If 
you really want the cash back, the best course may be to cancel the 
original order and go back to Extrabux to place a new online order.</p>

back. When filing a Missing Purchase Report, please be sure to give us 
as much information as possible on the order, so we can make the best 
case to the store.  Also, think through anything you may have done that 
could have invalidated the cash back, as this information is also 
helpful, as we work through possible scenarios with the store.</p>

				<h3>What is the difference between Pending, Available, and Processing cash back, as shown in my account?</h3>
				<p class="a">Pending cash back is the amount that you have earned 
but that cannot yet be withdrawn because the return time (90 days) on 
those purchases have not yet passed. Once the 90 day return time passes,
 the cash back for that purchase will become "Available," and cash back 
can be withdrawn, ($10 minimum). After you request Available cash back 
it becomes Processing until the cash back is sent out (usually within 5 
business days).</p>

				<a name="7-9"></a>
				<h3>I want to request a payment. How long will it take for me to receive my cash back?</h3>
				<p class="a">When the Available cash back balance in your account is
 over $10 you can request a payment. We typically process cash back 
payments once each week. From the date you request your payment, it 
should take 5 business days or less if you choose to receive your 
payment via PayPal, and up to 2 weeks if you request a paper check sent 
in the mail. Make sure you have selected your method of payment and that
 you have your correct PayPal email address or current mailing address 
on your Account Settings page.</p>

				<a name="7-10"></a>
				<h3>Cash back in My Account is listed as Unavailable.  What does that mean?</h3>

				<p class="a">Cash back becomes "Unavailable" when the merchant 
notifies Extrabux that the purchase may be fraudulent. In rare cases, 
your purchase may incorrectly be marked as fraudulent. If this is the 
case, please let us know and we will review the purchase with the 
merchant, and change the cash back to Available if appropriate.  Until 
we hear from you we will need to withhold payment of this cash back, so 
please <a href="http://www.extrabux.com/help/contact">Contact Us</a>.</p>

			<h2>8. Refer-a-Friend</h2>

				
				<a name="9-1"></a>
				<h3>Can I refer my friends and family to Extrabux so they can get cash back, too?</h3>
				<p class="a">Yes!  We love referrals. There are several ways to 
refer your friends and family to Extrabux so they can get cash back on 
their online purchases.  With our Refer-a-Friend program, it's very easy
 to do!  Every member of Extrabux can earn eGift cards for referring 
friends. On your <a href="http://www.extrabux.com/help/users/profile">My Account</a>
 page there is a tab on the right that says Refer-a-Friend. Click on 
that tab and you will see several options for referring your friends, 
including your own unique referral link that you can email to friends or
 share on your blog, as well as Facebook and Twitter links.  You can 
also share the great cash back stores and product deals that you find on
 Extrabux.  Near the top of every store and product page there is a 
"Tell a Friend" link uniquely tagged to you enabling you to share that 
deal through email, Facebook, Twitter and more!</p>
				<div class="returnToTop"><a href="#top">Return to Top</a></div>

				<a name="9-2"></a>

				<h3>How does the Refer-a-Friend eGift card program work?</h3>
				<p class="a">When you refer friends to Extrabux you have the 
opportunity to get $10 in eGift Cards from Drugstore.com, Macy's, HP, 
The North Face, or Sierra Trading Post. It's our way of saying "thanks!"
 for spreading the word!  If someone you refer joins Extrabux within 7 
days after clicking your link, we'll add $10 to your eGift Card balance 
as soon as they make their first purchase over $10. So encourage your 
friends to click on your link and go shopping!  You can refer as many 
people as you like. You must have at least $10 in Extrabux purchases to 
redeem your eGift Cards.  You can use your eGift cards for your own 
purchases on Extrabux, and remember to go through Extrabux to get cash 
back on your orders!</p>
				<div class="returnToTop"><a href="#top">Return to Top</a></div>

				<a name="9-3"></a>
				<h3>I sent my referral link to all of my friends. How can I see how many of them have signed up and if I've earned eGift cards?</h3>
				<p class="a">You can see the status of your referral activity by logging in to your Extrabux account and clicking on <a href="http://www.extrabux.com/help/users/profile">My Account</a>.
 Click on the "Refer-a-Friend" tab and you will see a summary of your 
activity. Under the Referral Overview you can see how many people signed
 up for Extrabux using your unique referral link and how many of those 
people made a purchase through Extrabux, which qualifies you to get your
 eGift Card Bonus. Under the Gift Card Rewards section you will see the 
value of the eGift cards you have earned through the Refer-a-Friend 
program (in $10 increments) and how many of those you have redeemed.</p>

				<div class="returnToTop"><a href="#top">Return to Top</a></div>

				<a name="9-4"></a>
				<h3>My friend joined Extrabux using my unique referral link but 
didn't place an order yet. Can I get an eGift card for them joining now?</h3>
				<p class="a">Not yet. Your friends must spend at least $10 through 
Extrabux for you to be eligible for the eGift card bonus.  You will not 
get the $10 eGift card credit until they have placed an order for at 
least $10 by clicking through to one of Extrabux's 1,500+ online stores.
  Their order must post to Extrabux for you to be eligible for the 
Refer-a-Friend eGift card.</p>
				<div class="returnToTop"><a href="#top">Return to Top</a></div>
				
				<a name="9-5"></a>

				<h3>I've referred friends to Extrabux and I want to use my eGift cards to order something. Can I get cash back?</h3>
				<p class="a">Yes! You can use your eGift cards to pay for your own 
orders on Extrabux, so long as you have at least $10 in non-gift card 
purchases in your Extrabux account.  It's like free money to shop 
through Extrabux and still get cash back, just for referring your 
friends! When using your eGift Cards, make sure you still click through 
from Extrabux to the store so that you get cash back.</p>
				<div class="returnToTop"><a href="#top">Return to Top</a></div>
				
				<a name="9-6"></a>
				<h3>I've referred people to Extrabux but they didn't use my personal referral link. Can I still get a Refer-a-Friend bonus?</h3>
				<p class="a">If your friends didn't use your unique referral link 
when they became an Extrabux member, then we have no way to track their 
membership back to you in our system. Your friends must use your link 
that you sent them through email, Facebook or Twitter for you to get the
 referral credit and eGift cards.</p>
