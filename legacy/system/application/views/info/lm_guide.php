        <div style="float:left;width:100%;"><hr color="#e96d08" style="margin-left:10px;"></div>

        <p>We get it, the best part of Beesavy is <span class="orange">Social Shopping</span>. I mean, how could you not like getting
        <span class="orange">cashback</span> whenever your friends or family buy their everyday items at their favorite stores?</p>

        <p>But how do you gets your friends involved in Beesavy without coming across like a weirdo
        salesperson???</p>

        <p>Easy. Follow these <span class="green">4 STEPS</span> and your friends will be just as excited as you are!</p>

        <p><span class="green">1. Send your friend a Facebook message or a text asking them this:</span><br>
        <span class="orange indent">“Hey there, I have two random questions for you.<br>
        1. Do you use (pick a couple of Beesavy Partner Stores that they shop at), and<br>
        2. Do your friends shop at those same stores?”</span></p>

        <p>Everybody always says yes, because, c'mon, everybody buys stuff!</p>

        <p><span class="green">2. After they say yes, the next question is,</span><br>
        <span class="orange indent">“Can you watch this 2 minute video and tell me if this makes sense to you?”</span></p>

        <div style="margin: 20px auto; width: 213px;">
            <iframe width="213" height="120" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/G1tfGYWIKlI" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        </div>

        <p style="text-align: center"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1tfGYWIKlI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1tfGYWIKlI</a></p>

        <p>After watching the video, most people are blown away and extremely curious about how to join.
        For those that seem interested, just sign them up IMMEDIATELY using your special referral ID!
        Don't let them wait, and it's not like there is any reason to not join up, I mean its completely FREE!</p>

        <p><span class="green">3. Now have them click on the <a href="<?php echo s3path('/images/beesavy-partner-stores.png') ?>">BEESAVY TOP PARTNER STORES</a> link that is in the top
        left of your Dashboard. Just go through each category of shopping and ask them if they
        shop at any of these stores.</span><br>
        <span class="orange">The answer is ,”OF COURSE I SHOP AT ________!”</span></p>

        <p><span class="green">4. Next, have them watch the walk­through video, or just walk them through the process of
        shopping at whatever their favorite <span class="orange">BEESAVY TOP PARTNER STORE</span> is.</span></p>

        <div style="margin: 20px auto; width: 213px;">
            <iframe width="213" height="120" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/z-yD-tAkEUw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        </div>

        <p style="text-align: center"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-yD-tAkEUw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-yD-tAkEUw</a></p>

        <p>And that is it!!! Easy as pie, and now you will get a commission every time they shop through
        Beesavy at their favorite stores!</p>

        <p>BUT HOLD ON A SECOND!</p>

        <p>Ok, you might be one of those people that gets really excited at the thought of making LOTS of
        money when your friends and family shop! Remember, you get paid on 7 connection levels of
        shopping, so your BEEHIVE can grow extremely big and you can make BIG amounts of cash if
        you follow these extra steps.</p>

        <p>Once again, this is not for everybody! Some people are fine with just using Beesavy and referring
        a couple friends, and that is fantastic! But for the other people...here is a little plan to get you
        moving in the right direction.</p>

        <p>First of all, wouldn't you like to know how much money you could really make with Beesavy?
        Take a look at these figures and see what the possibilities are:</p>

        <p><span class="green">This drawing makes 3 assumptions:</span></p>

        <ol class="orange">
            <li>Your online shopping earns you at least $1.00 per month in cashback</li>
            <li>You sign­up five (5) of your friends and they also average at least $1.00 per month in cashback.</li>
            <li>Each of your five (5) friends signs up five (5) of their friends, etc.</li>
        </ol>

        <p></p>

        <div style="margin: 30px auto; width: 573px;">
            <img src="<?php echo s3path('/images/monthly_commission03.png') ?>">
        </div>

        <p><span class="orange">How to build a massive Beehive:</span></p>

        <ol>
            <li>Use Beesavy yourself for at least ONE MONTH before telling people about it. It's
            much easier to communicate a service that you have already used yourself.</li>
            <li>Find five (5) friends or family that will sign up, and use the 4 STEPS to walk them
            through the process.</li>
            <li>Have them use Beesavy for a month before they tell anyone else about it.</li>
            <li>Every month touch base with your 5 people, and help them if they have any
            questions or need help signing their friends up.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Can you sign up more than 5 people? OF COURSE, please, sign up 1,000, it's fine with us ;)</p>

        <p>Remember, sometimes when people hear about referral programs like this they automatically
        assume that this is a “MLM.” We get it, we have people ask us this all the time. We just
        remind people that it's</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Free. Forever. No, seriously, it's free.</li>
            <li>You are shopping at your favorite stores.</li>
            <li>You are buying the products you already buy.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>So that's it! Now go out and use your new found knowledge to build a huge BEEHIVE that makes
        you money every single month!</p>
