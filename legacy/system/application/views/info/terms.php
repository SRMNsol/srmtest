            <h2><STRONG>ELIGIBILITY</STRONG></h2>
            <p>To join BeeSavy and use our services, you must be at least 18 years of age. &nbsp;If you are under 18 years of age, you may join BeeSavy only with the supervision and consent of your parent or legal guardian. &nbsp;If you are under 13 years of age, you may not join BeeSavy. &nbsp;All members receiving payments via check must be U.S. residents. &nbsp;You must have Internet access and an email address to use BeeSavy and we are not responsible for your inability to connect to the Internet, access our website or your account.</p>

            <h2><STRONG>MEMBER RESPONSIBILITIES</STRONG></h2>
            <p>You are responsible for maintaining accurate account information at all times, including valid email and mailing addresses. &nbsp;You are responsible for keeping your email address, mailing address, password, and all other private information confidential. &nbsp;BeeSavy is not responsible for any changes made to your account by any party that uses your email address and password.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, referral tools such as banners and email tools are provided as a convenience to help users promote BeeSavy. &nbsp;It is the users' responsibility to obey all laws including anti-spam laws and fair use laws. &nbsp;Banners may only be placed on sites for which you have the authority to post such material and such sites must be suitable for a general family audience. &nbsp;Publicizing BeeSavy on any website with inappropriate or adult material is expressly forbidden and will result in termination of your account and forfeiture of any cash back or monies due with absolutely no recourse provided. &nbsp;In case of dispute regarding "appropriate use," it is at the sole discretion of BeeSavy.</p>

            <h2><STRONG>OUR RESPONSIBILITIES</STRONG></h2>
            <p>We will provide you with links on the BeeSavy website to the websites of affiliated merchants. &nbsp;When you click one of these links and make a qualifying purchase at that merchant's website, you will receive the specified amount of cash back. &nbsp;We will make every effort to accurately track and report your qualifying purchases, but you will not hold us liable for any delays or failures in tracking or reporting that are the fault of the merchant in reporting your purchase to us. &nbsp;Furthermore, you will not hold us liable for any technical failures that delay or prevent your purchase, and therefore your possible earnings from being reported to us. &nbsp;If you have disabled cookies or other technologies used in tracking purchases, this may be the cause of such technical failure. &nbsp;Other causes may include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li type="disc">You used a coupon from another website or from an email directly from the merchant. </li>
                <li type="disc">You added the item(s) to your shopping cart before clicking through from BeeSavy.com. </li>
                <li type="disc">Your purchase was for a gift card or was paid for with a gift card. </li>
                <li type="disc">You used a third party payment service such as Google Checkout to pay for the order. </li>
                <li type="disc">You closed your web browser window before completing your purchase. </li>
                <li type="disc">Your browser is not configured to accept cookies. </li>
            </ul>

            <p><STRONG>IN THE EVENT OF A DISPUTE BETWEEN YOU AND A MERCHANT LISTED ON THIS WEBSITE, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, YOU RELEASE BEESAVY, ITS AFFILIATES AND ANY THIRD PARTIES UNDER CONTRACT WITH BEESAVY, AND THEIR RESPECTIVE OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, AND LEGAL REPRESENTATIVES FROM AND AGAINST CLAIMS AND DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, KNOWN AND UNKNOWN, SUSPECTED AND UNSUSPECTED, DISCLOSED AND UNDISCLOSED, ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH SUCH A DISPUTE. </STRONG></p>
            <p>If you are a California resident, by using this website, you explicitly waive the rights granted to you under California Civil Code 1542, which states: "A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which, if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor."</p>

            <h2><STRONG>EXCEPTIONS</STRONG></h2>
            <p>Occasionally purchases at our affiliated merchants' websites will not generate commissions for BeeSavy. &nbsp;These include, but are not limited to, gift certificates, gift cards, and other items. &nbsp;BeeSavy is not obligated to pay cash back for purchases that do not generate a commission for BeeSavy. &nbsp;If you return an item to a merchant AFTER receiving your cash back check for the purchase of that item, BeeSavy has the right to recover these earnings from you and may take necessary actions, including check cancellation or deductions from your merchant return credit.</p>

            <h2><STRONG>INACTIVITY</STRONG></h2>
            <p>If your user account is inactive for 365 consecutive days, you hereby release all rights to cash in your account which shall automatically and immediately vest in BeeSavy without any requirement of notice to you.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, if you fail to make a purchase through your account for 90 consecutive days, you hereby release all rights to referral cash back for that period which shall automatically and immediately vest in BeeSavy without any requirement of notice to you.</p>

            <h2><STRONG>PAYMENTS</STRONG></h2>
            <p>The currency of all payments will be U.S. Dollars. &nbsp;We will only send out payments once you have at least $10.00 of available money (this includes cash back). &nbsp;Your cash back on a specific purchase will become available once the return time on that purchase has passed. &nbsp;Return times vary depending on the merchant but are generally (but not always) 60-90 days. &nbsp;Once the return time has passed we will deposit your earnings directly into your account and your earnings will become available for withdrawal. &nbsp;BeeSavy is not responsible for any event beyond the control of BeeSavy that would prevent you from receiving your payment. &nbsp;Such an event may include, but is not limited to, lost mail or an error made by you in typing your mailing address, or a change of address of which you have not notified BeeSavy. &nbsp;BeeSavy reserves the right to withhold payment of cash back indefinitely for any reason including: suspected fraud, merchant concerns, or unusual activity. &nbsp;If you feel your cash back payment is being improperly withheld, please contact us and we will be happy to work through the issue with you.</p>

                <li>6. &nbsp;A statement, as follows: "The information in this notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, I swear that I am the copyright owner or that I am authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed." </li>
            </ol>

            <p>Upon receipt of the written notification containing the information as outlined in 1 through 6 above:</p>

                <li>1.    &nbsp;BeeSavy shall remove or disable access to the Third Party Content that is alleged to be infringing; </li>
                <li>2.    &nbsp;BeeSavy shall forward the written notification to the alleged infringer (the "Subscriber"); </li>

            </ul>

            <h2><STRONG>COUNTER NOTIFICATION</STRONG></h2>
            <p>To be effective, a Counter Notification must be a written communication provided to BeeSavy's Designated Agent that includes substantially the following:

            <ul>

                <li>2.    &nbsp;Identification of the material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the material appeared before it was removed or access to it was disabled; </li>
                <li>3.    &nbsp;A statement, as follows: "I swear under penalty of perjury that it is my good faith belief that the material identified above was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled"; </li>

            </ul>

            <p>Upon receipt of a Counter Notification containing the information as outlined in 1 through 4 above, the DMCA provides that the removed material will be restored or access re-enabled and BeeSavy will comply with this requirement within a reasonable time (or as otherwise required by law), provided BeeSavy's Designated Agent has not received notice from the original complaining party that an action has been filed seeking a court order to restrain Subscriber from engaging in infringing activity relating to the material on BeeSavy's network or system.</p>

            <h2><STRONG>GENERAL</STRONG></h2>
            <p>If any provision of these terms is held to be invalid, void or unenforceable for any reason, such provision shall be struck and the remaining provisions shall remain enforceable. &nbsp;Headings are for reference purposes only and in no way define, limit, construe or describe the scope or extent of such section. &nbsp;Our failure to act with respect to a breach by you or others does not waive our right to act with respect to subsequent or similar breaches. &nbsp;You agree that these terms and all agreements and notices incorporated herein may be automatically assigned by BeeSavy, in our sole discretion, to a third party.
