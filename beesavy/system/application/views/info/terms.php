</p><h2><STRONG>OVERVIEW</STRONG>

<p>BeeSavy is an online shopping engine that combines price comparison with cash back discounts and online coupons.
</p>
<h2><STRONG>CASH BACK PAYMENT METHOD</STRONG>
</h2>

<p> BeeSavy pays its members by check, sent through postal mail, and electronically via PayPal.
</p>
<h2><STRONG>ELIGIBILITY</STRONG>
</h2>
<p>To join BeeSavy and use our services, you must be at least 18 years of age. &nbsp;If you are under 18 years of age, you may join BeeSavy only with the supervision and consent of your parent or legal guardian. &nbsp;If you are under 13 years of age, you may not join BeeSavy. &nbsp;All members receiving payments via check must be U.S. residents. &nbsp;You must have Internet access and an email address to use BeeSavy and we are not responsible for your inability to connect to the Internet, access our website or your account.
</p><h2><STRONG>MEMBER RESPONSIBILITIES</STRONG>
</h2>

<p>You are responsible for maintaining accurate account information at all times, including valid email and mailing addresses. &nbsp;You are responsible for keeping your email address, mailing address, password, and all other private information confidential. &nbsp;BeeSavy is not responsible for any changes made to your account by any party that uses your email address and password.
</p><p>Furthermore, referral tools such as banners and email tools are provided as a convenience to help users promote BeeSavy. &nbsp;It is the users' responsibility to obey all laws including anti-spam laws and fair use laws. &nbsp;Banners may only be placed on sites for which you have the authority to post such material and such sites must be suitable for a general family audience. &nbsp;Publicizing BeeSavy on any website with inappropriate or adult material is expressly forbidden and will result in termination of your account and forfeiture of any cash back or monies due with absolutely no recourse provided. &nbsp;In case of dispute regarding "appropriate use," it is at the sole discretion of BeeSavy. 
</p><h2><STRONG>OUR RESPONSIBILITIES</STRONG>
</h2><p>We will provide you with links on the BeeSavy website to the websites of affiliated merchants. &nbsp;When you click one of these links and make a qualifying purchase at that merchant's website, you will receive the specified amount of cash back. &nbsp;We will make every effort to accurately track and report your qualifying purchases, but you will not hold us liable for any delays or failures in tracking or reporting that are the fault of the merchant in reporting your purchase to us. &nbsp;Furthermore, you will not hold us liable for any technical failures that delay or prevent your purchase, and therefore your possible earnings from being reported to us. &nbsp;If you have disabled cookies or other technologies used in tracking purchases, this may be the cause of such technical failure. &nbsp;Other causes may include:</p>
<ul>
<li type="disc">You used a coupon from another website or from an email directly from the merchant. </li>
<li type="disc">You added the item(s) to your shopping cart before clicking through from BeeSavy.com. </li>
<li type="disc">Your purchase was for a gift card or was paid for with a gift card. </li>
<li type="disc">You used a third party payment service such as Google Checkout to pay for the order. </li>
<li type="disc">You closed your web browser window before completing your purchase. </li>
<li type="disc">Your browser is not configured to accept cookies. </li>
</ul>

<p><STRONG>IN THE EVENT OF A DISPUTE BETWEEN YOU AND A MERCHANT LISTED ON THIS WEBSITE, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, YOU RELEASE BEESAVY, ITS AFFILIATES AND ANY THIRD PARTIES UNDER CONTRACT WITH BEESAVY, AND THEIR RESPECTIVE OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, AND LEGAL REPRESENTATIVES FROM AND AGAINST CLAIMS AND DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, KNOWN AND UNKNOWN, SUSPECTED AND UNSUSPECTED, DISCLOSED AND UNDISCLOSED, ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH SUCH A DISPUTE. </STRONG>
</p><p>If you are a California resident, by using this website, you explicitly waive the rights granted to you under California Civil Code 1542, which states: "A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which, if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor." 
</p><h2><STRONG>EXCEPTIONS</STRONG>
</h2>
<p>Occasionally purchases at our affiliated merchants' websites will not generate commissions for BeeSavy. &nbsp;These include, but are not limited to, gift certificates, gift cards, and other items. &nbsp;BeeSavy is not obligated to pay cash back for purchases that do not generate a commission for BeeSavy. &nbsp;If you return an item to a merchant AFTER receiving your cash back check for the purchase of that item, BeeSavy has the right to recover these earnings from you and may take necessary actions, including check cancellation or deductions from your merchant return credit.
</p><h2><STRONG>INACTIVITY</STRONG>
</h2><p>If your user account is inactive for 365 consecutive days, you hereby release all rights to cash in your account which shall automatically and immediately vest in BeeSavy without any requirement of notice to you.
</p><p>Furthermore, if you fail to make a purchase through your account for 90 consecutive days, you hereby release all rights to referral cash back for that period which shall automatically and immediately vest in BeeSavy without any requirement of notice to you.
</p><h2><STRONG>PAYMENTS</STRONG>
</h2>
<p>The currency of all payments will be U.S. Dollars. &nbsp;We will only send out payments once you have at least $10.00 of available money (this includes cash back). &nbsp;Your cash back on a specific purchase will become available once the return time on that purchase has passed. &nbsp;Return times vary depending on the merchant but are generally (but not always) 60-90 days. &nbsp;Once the return time has passed we will deposit your earnings directly into your account and your earnings will become available for withdrawal. &nbsp;BeeSavy is not responsible for any event beyond the control of BeeSavy that would prevent you from receiving your payment. &nbsp;Such an event may include, but is not limited to, lost mail or an error made by you in typing your mailing address, or a change of address of which you have not notified BeeSavy. &nbsp;BeeSavy reserves the right to withhold payment of cash back indefinitely for any reason including: suspected fraud, merchant concerns, or unusual activity. &nbsp;If you feel your cash back payment is being improperly withheld, please contact us and we will be happy to work through the issue with you.

</p><h2><STRONG>GOVERNING LAW</STRONG>
</h2>
<p>These terms will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, without regard to principles of conflicts or choice of law. &nbsp;In addition, the application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods, including any amendments thereto, is expressly excluded hereby. &nbsp;Except for disputes arising from an alleged violation of intellectual property rights or breach of confidentiality, for which the injured party may suffer irreparable harm and may seek a restraining order, preliminary injunctive relief, an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief and/or legal remedies, and actions to enforce the decisions of the arbitrators, for which action may be taken in any court of competent jurisdiction, all disputes arising out of or related to this Agreement, including the scope, the construction or application of this Agreement, shall be resolved by arbitration in accordance with the commercial arbitration rules of the American Arbitration Association then in force. &nbsp;The arbitration hearings and all meetings pursuant to this section shall be held in Syracuse, New York, USA, and shall be conducted in English. &nbsp;If the parties cannot agree upon a single arbitrator within fifteen (15) days after demand by either of them, each party shall select one arbitrator knowledgeable about Internet commerce in New York and the USA generally, and notify the other of its selection, and such two arbitrators shall select a third from a list of arbitrators (with knowledge of the Internet industry) qualified by the American Arbitration Association in New York. &nbsp;If this procedure for selecting arbitrators fails, then a neutral arbitrator based in New York with knowledge of Internet commerce in New York and the USA generally shall be selected by the American Arbitration Association to resolve the dispute. &nbsp;The arbitrator(s) shall conduct a hearing within thirty (30) days after their selection. &nbsp;A majority of the arbitrators (if there is more than one pursuant to this clause) shall determine the decision/award, which shall be rendered within five (5) days after the completion of the hearing. &nbsp;The decision of the arbitrator(s) shall be final and binding upon the parties both as to law and to fact, and shall not be appealable to any court in any jurisdiction. &nbsp;The parties shall share the expenses of the arbitrators equally. &nbsp;Nothing in any indemnification provision hereunder shall be construed as having any bearing on the award of attorneys' fees or arbitrators' fees under this section.
