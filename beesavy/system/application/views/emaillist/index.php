				<p class="a"><ul><li>Try again. BeeSavy's search engine covers millions of different products, so here are some tips to help you find what you're looking for:</li></ul>
                 <ul class="faq-list">
<li>Mouse traps, a computer mouse, or the latest Modest Mouse CD?  &nbsp;Words often have multiple meanings and implications, so be sure your search phrase clearly specifies the type of product you're looking for.</li>
<li>Be specific. If you're looking for a particular product, try typing that product's model number into the BeeSavy search bar.</li>
<li>Refine Search. Be sure to use the filters on the left side of the search results to help narrow and improve the results.</li>

				<div class="returnToTop"><a href="#top">Return to Top</a></div>

				<a name="2-8"></a>
				<h3>Why do store prices sometimes differ from the list price I saw on BeeSavy?</h3>
				<p class="a"><ul><li>BeeSavy does its best to show accurate list prices, but sometimes a store will change its price before we've had a chance to update our database.</li></ul></p>
				<div class="returnToTop"><a href="#top">Return to Top</a></div>

				<a name="2-9"></a>
				<h3>Why do tax and shipping costs sometimes differ from what I saw on BeeSavy?</h3>
				<p class="a"><ul><li>BeeSavy does its best to show accurate tax and shipping costs, but please keep in mind that for some stores, the tax and shipping costs shown are only estimates. Sales tax estimates are based on your zip code and the sales tax policies of the merchant. Shipping cost estimates are based on the product weight, shipping destination, distribution center location, and carrier used (UPS, USPS, FedEx, DHL, etc.). In some cases, however, BeeSavy is not provided with all information necessary to estimate the exact tax and shipping costs.</li></ul></p>

				<h3>It has been longer than 4 days and a purchase isn't showing up in my account. &nbsp;What should I do?</h3>
				<p class="a"><ul><li>Purchases typically take 1-4 days to post to your account. If it has been longer than 4 days, please <a href="/info/contact">Contact Us</a> and choose "Where's My Cash Back?" as the Subject. Please make sure that you have received order confirmation from the merchant before filing a Missing Purchase Report.

                	<ul class="faq-list">
<li>You used a coupon not provided by BeeSavy</li>

				<div class="returnToTop"><a href="#top">Return to Top</a></div>

				<a name="4-15"></a>
				<h3>What is the difference between Pending, Available, and Processing cash back, as shown in my account?</h3>
				<p class="a"><ul><li>Pending cash back is the amount that you have earned but that cannot yet be withdrawn because the return times (15-75 days) on those purchases have not yet passed. Once the return time on a purchase passes, the cash back for that purchase will become available, and will then be considered Available cash back. Processing cash back refers to the money that is available and currently in the process of being sent to you.</li></ul></p>

                <a name="4-16"></a>
				<h3>What is the difference between Pending and Available Referral cash back?</h3>
				<p class="a"><ul><li>Pending Referral cash back is commission from people you've referred that can't be withdrawn yet because either the return period has not yet passed OR you have not made a purchase through BeeSavy in the previous 90 days.  Once the return time on the purchase passes and you have made a purchase through BeeSavy in the previous 90 days, the referral commission for that purchase will become available, and will then be considered Available Referral cash back. </li></ul></p>

				<a name="4-17"></a>
				<h3>How long will I have to wait for my cash back to become Available?</h3>
				<p class="a"><ul><li>Your purchase will be posted to your account within 1-4 days, but your earnings on a specific purchase will become Available for payment once the return time on that purchase has passed. Return times vary depending on the store but are generally between 15-75 days. Once the return time has passed, your cash back earnings will become available for withdrawal.</li></ul></p>
				<div class="returnToTop"><a href="#top">Return to Top</a></div>

				<a name="4-18"></a>
				<h3>Can I use any payment method at a store's checkout and still earn cash back?</h3>
				<p class="a"><ul><li>You can use your credit card, debit card, or PayPal account at checkout and still earn cash back.

				<h3>Am I taxed on the cash back I receive from BeeSavy?</h3>
				<p class="a"><ul><li>We're shoppers, not lawyers and this is not intended to be tax advice.  BeeSavy is not required to report the cash back that it pays you on your personal spending (personal cash back).  We are required to report referral cash back (commission from people you refer to BeeSavy) once that amount exceeds $600 in a calendar year.  As such, we will contact you to get additional information when you are approaching $600 in referral cash back.  We will also provide you with a 1099-MISC form for your tax preparation requirements.</li></ul></p>

				<h3>It has been longer than 4 days and a purchase isn't showing up in my account. &nbsp;What should I do?</h3>
				<p class="a"><ul><li>Purchases typically take 1-4 days to post to your account. &nbsp;If it has been longer than 4 days, please <a href="/contact">Contact Us</a> and choose "Where's My Cash Back?" as the Subject. &nbsp;Please make sure that you have received order confirmation from the store before filing a Missing Purchase Report. &nbsp;It is also possible that your cash back has not posted to your account for other reasons:</li></ul>
                <ul class="faq-list">
<li>	You used a coupon not provided by BeeSavy</li>
<li>	You added items to your shopping cart before clicking through from BeeSavy</li>
<li>	You have cookies disabled</li>

				<h3>What is the difference between Pending, Available, and Processing cash back, as shown in my account?</h3>
				<p class="a"><ul><li>Pending cash back is the amount that you have earned but that cannot yet be withdrawn because the return times on the purchases that earned you that money have not yet passed. &nbsp;Once the return time on a purchase passes, the cash back for that purchase will become available, and will then be considered Available cash back. &nbsp;Processing cash back refers to the money that is available and currently in the process of being sent to you.</li></ul></p>

                <h3>What is the difference between Pending and Available Referral cash back?</h3>
<p class="a"><ul><li>Pending Referral cash back is commission from people you've referred that can't be withdrawn yet because either the return period has not yet passed OR you have not made a purchase through BeeSavy in the previous 90 days. &nbsp;Once the return time on the purchase passes and you have made a purchase through BeeSavy in the previous 90 days, the referral commission for that purchase will become available, and will then be considered Available Referral cash back. </li></ul></p>
